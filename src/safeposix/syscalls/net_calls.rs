    /// ### Description
    ///
    /// `bind_syscall` - when a socket is created with socket_syscall, it exists
    /// in a name  space (address family) but has no address assigned to it.
    /// bind_syscall  assigns the address specified by localaddr to the
    /// socket referred to  by the file descriptor fd.
    ///
    /// ### Arguments
    ///
    /// it accepts two parameters:
    /// * `fd` - an open file descriptor
    /// * `localaddr` - the address to bind to the socket referred to by fd
    ///
    /// ### Returns
    ///
    /// On success, zero is returned.  On error, -errno is returned, and
    /// errno is set to indicate the error.
    ///
    /// ### Errors
    ///
    /// * EACCES - The address is protected, and the user is not the superuser.
    /// * EADDRINUSE - The given address is already in use.
    /// * EADDRINUSE - (Internet domain sockets) The port number was specified
    ///   as zero in the socket address structure, but, upon attempting to bind
    ///   to an ephemeral port, it was determined that all port numbers in the
    ///   ephemeral port range are currently in use.  See the discussion of
    ///   /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range ip(7).
    /// * EBADF - sockfd is not a valid file descriptor.
    /// * EINVAL - The socket is already bound to an address.
    /// * EINVAL - addrlen is wrong, or addr is not a valid address for this
    ///   socket's domain.
    /// * ENOTSOCK - The file descriptor sockfd does not refer to a socket.
    ///
    /// The following errors are specific to UNIX domain (AF_UNIX)
    /// sockets:
    ///
    /// * EACCES - Search permission is denied on a component of the path
    ///   prefix.  (See also path_resolution(7).)
    /// * EADDRNOTAVAIL - A nonexistent interface was requested or the requested
    ///   address was not local.
    /// * EFAULT - addr points outside the user's accessible address space.
    /// * ELOOP - Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving addr.
    /// * ENAMETOOLONG - addr is too long.
    /// * ENOENT - A component in the directory prefix of the socket pathname
    ///   does not exist.
    /// * ENOMEM - Insufficient kernel memory was available.
    /// * ENOTDIR - A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
    /// * EROFS - The socket inode would reside on a read-only filesystem.

    /// ## ------------------SELECT SYSCALL------------------
    /// ### Description
    /// The `select_syscall()` allows a program to monitor multiple file
    /// descriptors, waiting until one or more of the file descriptors become
    /// "ready" for some class of I/O operation (e.g., input possible).  A
    /// file descriptor is considered ready if it is possible to perform a
    /// corresponding I/O operation (e.g., `read_syscall()`) without blocking.

    /// ### Function Arguments
    /// The `select_syscall()` receives five arguments:
    /// * `nfds` - This argument should be set to the highest-numbered file
    ///   descriptor in any of the three sets, plus 1.  The indicated file
    ///   descriptors in each set are checked, up to this limit.
    /// * `readfds` -  The file descriptors in this set are watched to see if
    ///   they are ready for reading.  A file descriptor is ready for reading if
    ///   a read operation will not block; in particular, a file descriptor is
    ///   also ready on end-of-file. After select() has returned, readfds will
    ///   be cleared of all file descriptors except for those that are ready for
    ///   reading.
    /// * `writefds` - The file descriptors in this set are watched to see if
    ///   they are ready for writing.  A file descriptor is ready for writing if
    ///   a write operation will not block.  However, even if a file descriptor
    ///   indicates as writable, a large write may still block. After select()
    ///   has returned, writefds will be cleared of all file descriptors except
    ///   for those that are ready for writing.
    /// * `exceptfds` - currently not supported, only the validity of the fds
    ///   will be checked
    /// * `timeout` - The timeout argument is a RustDuration structure that
    ///   specifies the interval that select() should block waiting for a file
    ///   descriptor to become ready.  The call will block until either: •  a
    ///   file descriptor becomes ready; •  the call is interrupted by a signal
    ///   handler; or •  the timeout expires.

    /// ### Returns
    /// On success, select() and return the number of file descriptors contained
    /// in the two returned descriptor sets (that is, the total number of
    /// bits that are set in readfds, writefds). The return value may be zero if
    /// the timeout expired before any file descriptors became ready.
    /// Otherwise, errors or panics are returned for different scenarios.
    ///
    /// ### Errors
    /// * EBADF - An invalid file descriptor was given in one of the sets. (e.g.
    ///   a file descriptor that was already closed.)
    /// * EINTR - A signal was caught.
    /// * EINVAL -  nfds is negative or exceeds the FD_SET_MAX_FD.
    ///
    /// ### Panics
    /// No panic is expected from this syscall

    /// ## ------------------POLL SYSCALL------------------
    /// ### Description
    /// poll_syscall performs a similar task to select_syscall: it waits for
    /// one of a set of file descriptors to become ready to perform I/O.

    /// ### Function Arguments
    /// The `poll_syscall()` receives two arguments:
    /// * `fds` - The set of file descriptors to be monitored is specified in
    ///   the fds argument, which is an array of PollStruct structures
    ///   containing three fields: fd, events and revents. events and revents
    ///   are requested events and returned events, respectively. The field fd
    ///   contains a file descriptor for an open file. If this field is
    ///   negative, then the corresponding events field is ignored and the
    ///   revents field returns zero. The field events is an input parameter, a
    ///   bit mask specifying the events the application is interested in for
    ///   the file descriptor fd. The bits returned in revents can include any
    ///   of those specified in events, or POLLNVAL. The bits that may be
    ///   set/returned in events and revents are: 1. POLLIN: There is data to
    ///   read. 2. POLLPRI: There is some exceptional condition on the file
    ///   descriptor, currently not supported 3. POLLOUT: Writing is now
    ///   possible, though a write larger than the available space in a socket
    ///   or pipe will still block
    ///   4. POLLNVAL: Invalid request: fd not open (only returned in revents;
    ///   ignored in events).
    /// * `timeout` - The timeout argument is a RustDuration structure that
    ///   specifies the interval that poll() should block waiting for a file
    ///   descriptor to become ready. The call will block until either: 1.  a
    ///   file descriptor becomes ready; 2. the call is interrupted by a signal
    ///   handler; 3. the timeout expires.

    /// ### Returns
    /// On success, poll_syscall returns a nonnegative value which is the
    /// number of elements in the pollfds whose revents fields have been
    /// set to a nonzero value (indicating an event or an error). A
    /// return value of zero indicates that the system call timed out
    /// before any file descriptors became ready.
    ///
    /// ### Errors
    /// * EINTR - A signal was caught.
    /// * EINVAL - fd exceeds the FD_SET_MAX_FD.
    ///
    /// ### Panics
    /// No panic is expected from this syscall

        // current implementation of poll_syscall is based on select_syscall
        // which gives several issues:
        // 1. according to standards, select_syscall should only support file descriptor
        //    that is smaller than 1024, while poll_syscall should not have such
        //    limitation but our implementation of poll_syscall is actually calling
        //    select_syscall directly which would mean poll_syscall would also have the
        //    1024 maximum size limitation However, rustposix itself only support file
        //    descriptor that is smaller than 1024 which solves this issue automatically
        //    in an interesting way
        // 2. current implementation of poll_syscall is very inefficient, that it passes
        //    each of the file descriptor into select_syscall one by one. A better
        //    solution might be transforming pollstruct into fdsets and pass into
        //    select_syscall once (TODO). A even more efficienct way would be completely
        //    rewriting poll_syscall so it does not depend on select_syscall anymore.
        //    This is also how Linux does for poll_syscall since Linux claims that poll
        //    have a better performance than select.
        // 3. several revent value such as POLLERR (which should be set when pipe is
        //    broken), or POLLHUP (when peer closed its channel) are not possible to
        //    monitor. Since select_syscall does not have these features, so our
        //    poll_syscall, which derived from select_syscall, would subsequently not be

    /// ## ------------------SOCKETPAIR SYSCALL------------------
    /// ### Description
    /// The `socketpair_syscall()` call creates an unnamed pair of connected
    /// sockets in the specified domain, of the specified type, and using
    /// the optionally specified protocol.
    /// The file descriptors used in referencing the new sockets are returned
    /// in sv.sock1 and sv.sock2. The two sockets are indistinguishable.
    /// ### Function Arguments
    /// The `socketpair_syscall()` receives four arguments:
    /// * `domain` -  The domain argument specifies a communication domain; this
    ///   selects the protocol family which will be used for communication.
    ///   Currently supported domains are AF_UNIX, AF_INET and AF_INET6.
    /// * `socktype` - specifies the communication semantics. Currently defined
    ///   types are:
    ///                1. SOCK_STREAM Provides sequenced, reliable, two-way,
    ///                   connection-based byte streams.  An out-of-band data
    ///                   transmission mechanism may be supported.
    ///                2. SOCK_DGRAM Supports datagrams (connectionless,
    ///                   unreliable messages of a fixed maximum length). The
    ///                   type argument serves a second purpose: in addition to
    ///                   specifying a socket type, it may include the bitwise
    ///                   OR of any of the following values, to modify the
    ///                   behavior of the socket:
    ///                1. SOCK_NONBLOCK Set the O_NONBLOCK file status flag on
    ///                   the open file description referred to by the new file
    ///                   descriptor.
    ///                2. SOCK_CLOEXEC Set the close-on-exec flag on the new
    ///                   file descriptor.
    /// * `protocol` - The protocol specifies a particular protocol to be used
    ///   with the socket. Currently only support the default protocol
    ///   (IPPROTO_TCP).
    /// * `sv` -  The file descriptors used in referencing the new sockets are
    ///   returned in sv.sock1 and sv.sock2. The two sockets are
    ///   indistinguishable.

    /// ### Returns
    /// On success, zero is returned. Otherwise, errors or panics are returned
    /// for different scenarios.
    ///
    /// ### Errors
    /// * EAFNOSUPPORT - The specified address family is not supported on this
    ///   machine.
    /// * EOPNOTSUPP - The specified protocol does not support creation of
    ///   socket pairs.
    /// * EINVAL - The specified flag is not valid
    /// * ENFILE - no enough file descriptors can be assigned
    ///
    /// ### Panics
    /// No Panic is expected for this syscall.

    // Because socketpair needs to spawn off a helper thread to connect the two ends
    // of the socket pair, and because that helper thread, along with the main
    // thread, need to access the cage to call methods (syscalls) of it, and because
    // rust's threading model states that any reference passed into a thread but
    // not moved into it mut have a static lifetime, we cannot use a standard member
    // function to perform this syscall, and must use an arc wrapped cage
    // instead as a "this" parameter in lieu of self
