//! This module contains all filesystem-related system calls.
//!
//! ## Notes:
//!
//! - These calls are implementations of the [`Cage`] struct in the [`safeposix`](crate::safeposix) crate. See the [`safeposix`](crate::safeposix) crate for more information.
//! They have been structed as different modules for better maintainability and related functions. since they are tied to the `Cage` struct
//! This module's rustdoc may turn up empty, thus they have been explicitly listed below for documentation purposes.

impl Cage {
    /// ## ------------------OPEN SYSCALL------------------
    /// ### Description
    /// The `open_syscall()` creates an open file description that refers to a file and a file descriptor that refers to that open file description.
    /// The file descriptor is used by other I/O functions to refer to that file.
    /// There are generally two cases which occur when this function is called.
    /// Case 1: If the file to be opened doesn't exist, then a new file is created at the given location and a new file descriptor is created.
    /// Case 2: If the file already exists, then a few conditions are checked and based on them, file is updated accordingly.

    /// ### Function Arguments
    /// The `open_syscall()` receives three arguments:
    /// * `path` - This argument points to a pathname naming the file.
    ///           For example: "/parentdir/file1" represents a file which will be either opened if exists or will be created at the given path.
    /// * `flags` - This argument contains the file status flags and file access modes which will be alloted to the open file description.
    ///            The flags are combined together using a bitwise-inclusive-OR and the result is passed as an argument to the function.
    ///            Some of the most common flags used are: O_CREAT | O_TRUNC | O_RDWR | O_EXCL | O_RDONLY | O_WRONLY, with each representing a different file mode.
    /// * `mode` - This represents the permission of the newly created file.
    ///           The general mode used is "S_IRWXA": which represents the read, write, and search permissions on the new file.

    /// ### Returns
    /// Upon successful completion of this call, a file descriptor is returned which points the file which is opened.
    /// Otherwise, errors or panics are returned for different scenarios.
    ///
    /// ### Errors and Panics
    /// * ENFILE - no available file descriptor number could be found
    /// * ENOENT - tried to open a file that did not exist
    /// * EINVAL - the input flags contain S_IFCHR flag representing a special character file
    /// * EPERM - the mode bits for a file are not sane
    /// * ENOTDIR - tried to create a file as a child of something that isn't a directory
    /// * EEXIST - the file already exists and O_CREAT and O_EXCL flags were passed
    /// * ENXIO - the file is of type UNIX domain socket
    ///
    /// A panic occurs when there is some issue fetching the file descriptor.
    ///
    /// for more detailed description of all the commands and return values, see
    /// [open(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html)

    ///
    /// The `mkdir_syscall()` creates a new directory named by the path name pointed to by a path as the input parameter in the function.

    /// The newly created directory is empty with size 0 and is associated with a new inode of type "DIR".
    /// On successful completion, the timestamps for both the newly formed directory and its parent are updated along with their linkcounts.

    /// ### Arguments
    ///
    /// * `path` - This represents the path at which the new directory will be created.
    ///     For example: `/parentdir/dir` represents the new directory name as `dir`, which will be created at this path (`/parentdir/dir`).
    /// * `mode` - This represents the permission of the newly created directory.
    ///     The general mode used is `S_IRWXA`: which represents the read, write, and search permissions on the new directory.
    ///
    /// ### Returns
    ///
    /// Upon successful creation of the directory, 0 is returned.
    ///
    /// ### Errors
    ///
    /// * ENOENT - if given path was null or the parent directory does not exist in the inode table.
    /// * EPERM - if mode bits were not set.
    /// * EEXIST - if a directory with the same name already exists at the given path.
    ///
    /// ### Panics
    ///
    /// * If truepath.file_name() returns None or if to_str() fails, causing unwrap() to panic.
    /// * If the parent inode does not exist in the inode table, causing unwrap() to panic.
    /// * If the code execution reaches the unreachable!() macro, indicating a logical inconsistency in the program.

    /// ## ------------------MKNOD SYSCALL------------------
    /// ### Description
    ///
    /// The `mknod_syscall()` creates a filesystem node (file, device special file
    /// or pipe) named by a path as the input parameter.
    /// The file type and the permissions of the new file are initialized from the
    /// "mode" provided as the input parameter.
    /// There are 5 different file types: S_IFREG, S_IFCHR, S_IFBLK, S_IFIFO, or
    /// S_IFSOCK representing a regular file, character special file, block special
    /// file, FIFO (named pipe), or UNIX domain socket, respectively.
    /// The newly created file is empty with size 0.
    /// On successful completion, the timestamps for both the newly created file
    /// and its parent are updated along with their linkcounts.
    ///
    /// ### Function Arguments
    ///
    /// The `mknod_syscall()` receives three arguments:
    /// * `path` - This argument points to a pathname naming the file.
    /// For example: "/parentdir/file" represents the new file name as "file",
    /// which will be created at this path (/parentdir/file).
    ///
    /// * `mode` - The mode argument specifies both the permissions to use and the
    /// type of node to be created. It is a combination (using bitwise OR) of one
    /// of the file types and the permissions for the new node.
    /// FileType - In LIND, we have only implemented the file type of "Character
    /// Device" represented by S_IFCHR flag.
    /// FilePermission - The general permission mode used is "S_IRWXA": which
    /// represents the read, write, and search permissions on the new file.
    /// The final file mode is represented by the bitwise-OR of FileType and
    /// FilePermission Flags.
    ///
    /// * `dev` - It is a configuration-dependent specification of a character or
    /// block I/O device. If mode does not indicate a block special or character
    /// special device, dev is ignored.
    /// Since "CharDev" is the only supported type, 'dev' is represented using
    /// makedev() function; that returns a formatted device number   
    /// For example: "makedev(&DevNo { major: majorId, minor: minorId })" accepts a
    /// Device Number that consists of a MajorID, identifying the class of the device,
    /// and a minor ID, identifying a specific instance of a device in that class.
    ///
    /// ### Returns
    ///
    /// Upon successful creation of the file, 0 is returned.
    /// Otherwise, errors or panics are returned for different scenarios.
    ///
    /// ### Errors
    ///
    /// * `ENOENT` - occurs when a directory component in the absolute path does
    /// not exist
    /// * `EPERM` - the mode bits for the new file are not sane
    /// * `EINVAL` - when any other file type (regular, socket, block, fifo) instead
    /// of character file type is passed
    /// * `EEXIST` - when the file to be created already exists
    ///
    /// ### Panics
    ///
    /// We don't have panics for mknod_syscall() as of now.

    /// This function duplicates a file descriptor. It creates a new file
    /// descriptor that refers to the same open file description as the original file descriptor.
    /// * Finding the Next Available File Descriptor: If `start_desc` is provided and it is already in use, the function
    ///   will continue searching for the next available file descriptor starting from `start_desc`. If no file
    ///   descriptors are available, it will return an error (`ENFILE`).
    /// * If `fd` is equal to `start_fd`, the function returns `start_fd` as the new file
    ///   descriptor. This is because in this scenario, the original and new file descriptors would point to the same
    ///   file description.

    ///   allocation of a new file descriptor, updating the file descriptor table, and incrementing the reference count
    ///   of the file object.
    /// * The function modifies the global `filedescriptortable` array, adding a new entry for the
    ///   duplicated file descriptor. It also increments the reference count of the file object associated with the
    ///   original file descriptor.

    /// * Reference Counting: The function increments the reference count of the file object associated with the original file
    ///   descriptor. This ensures that the file object is not deleted until all its associated file descriptors are closed.

    ///   by incrementing the reference count of both the send and receive pipes.
    /// ### Function Arguments
    /// * `self`:  A reference to the `FsCalls` struct, which contains the file descriptor table and other system-related data.
    /// * `filedesc_enum`: A reference to the `FileDescriptor` object representing the file descriptor to be duplicated.
    /// * `newfd`: The new file descriptor number to assign to the duplicated file descriptor.

    /// ### Description
    ///
    /// `fcntl_syscall` performs operations, like returning or setting file status flags,
    /// duplicating a file descriptor, etc., on an open file descriptor
    ///
    /// ### Arguments
    ///
    /// it accepts three parameters:
    /// * `fd` - an open file descriptor
    /// * `cmd` - an operation to be performed on fd
    /// * `arg` - an optional argument (whether or not arg is required is determined by cmd)
    ///
    /// ### Returns
    ///
    /// for a successful call, the return value depends on the operation and can be one of: zero, the new file descriptor,
    /// value of file descriptor flags, value of status flags, etc.
    ///
    /// ### Errors
    ///
    /// * EBADF - fd is not a valid file descriptor
    /// * EINVAL - doesnt match implementation parameters
    ///
    /// ### Panics
    ///
    /// * invalid or out-of-bounds file descriptor), calling unwrap() on it will cause a panic.
    /// * Unknown errno value from fcntl returned, will cause panic.

    /// ### Description
    ///
    /// The `ioctl_syscall()` manipulates the underlying device parameters of special files. In particular, it is used as a way
    /// for user-space applications to interface with device drivers.
    ///
    /// ### Arguments
    ///
    /// The `ioctl_syscall()` accepts three arguments:
    /// * `fd` - an open file descriptor that refers to a device.
    /// * `request` - the control function to be performed. The set of valid request values depends entirely on the device
    ///              being addressed. MEDIA_IOC_DEVICE_INFO is an example of an ioctl control function to query device
    ///              information that all media devices must support.
    /// * `ptrunion` - additional information needed by the addressed device to perform the selected control function.

    /// obtained from the corresponding caller syscall.

    /// ### Arguments
    ///
    /// The `_chmod_helper()` accepts two arguments:
    /// * `inodenum` - an inode of a file whose mode bits we are willing to
    /// change obtained from the caller syscall.

    /// ### Returns
    ///
    /// Upon successful completion, zero is returned.
    /// In case of a failure, an error is returned, and `errno` is set depending
    /// on the error, e.g. EACCES, ENOENT, etc.

/// ### Description
/// This function implements the `getdents` system call, which reads directory entries from a directory file descriptor
/// and returns them in a buffer. Reading directory entries using multiple read calls can be less efficient because it
/// involves reading the data in smaller chunks and then parsing it.
/// getdents can often be faster by reading directory entries in a more optimized way.
///
/// ### Function Arguments
/// * `fd`: A file descriptor representing the directory to read.
/// * `dirp`: A pointer to a buffer where the directory entries will be written.
/// * `bufsize`: The size of the buffer in bytes.
///
/// ### Returns
/// * The number of bytes written to the buffer on success.
///
/// ### Errors and Panics
/// * `EINVAL(22)`: If the buffer size is too small or if the file descriptor is invalid.
/// * `ENOTDIR(20)`: If the file descriptor does not refer to a existing directory.
/// * `ESPIPE(29)`: If the file descriptor does not refer to a file.
